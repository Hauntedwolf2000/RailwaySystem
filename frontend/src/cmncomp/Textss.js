It is a subsidiary of Indian Railways and is responsible for online ticket booking, catering, and tourism services. IRCTC was established in 1999 and is headquartered in New Delhi, India.

IRCTC's online ticketing platform, called the IRCTC Next Generation e-Ticketing System, allows users to book train tickets, check train availability, and track the status of their bookings. The platform has also introduced various features such as e-wallets, cancellation and refund facilities, and the option to book meals and accommodation on trains.

Apart from ticketing services, IRCTC also offers catering services to passengers through its e-catering services. Passengers can pre-book meals and have them delivered to their seats during their train journey. IRCTC also manages a chain of restaurants under the brand name "Food Plaza" and "Jan Aahar" across various railway stations in India.

IRCTC also provides tourism services through its website, offering various tour packages and hotel bookings for destinations across India. The corporation has also introduced various luxury trains, such as the Maharaja Express and the Buddhist Circuit Tourist Train, which offer a unique travel experience to passengers
